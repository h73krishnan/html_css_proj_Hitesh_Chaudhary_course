## Project highlights
- position property used
- fontawesome icons are used [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons)

## Time taken (including the readme)
3.5 hours 

## Problems and solutions to them
1. icons were not displaying
- Solution : match the cdn link found in google and which used in the program
- It was matching, but still icons are not appearing
- Solution : there were two cdn links from 2020 and 2022
- So, choosing the link from 2022 solved the problem

2. Solution to simply visualization
- To have another html file with the fontawesome cdn and the icon
- This makes it faster to solve a problem

## Things I have learnt
- padding for only left and right side
```css
padding : 0 20px;
```
- gitbash was not opening with right click
    - unintsall and reinstall again

- aria-label
    - it is used for the surrounding screen to understand that the particular element is the button element
    - For example, aria-label="navabar" for a section gives clear intication that the section contains the navbar items

- classes are preferred for communication to the other programmer
    - list class for the man div of list of the navbar items
    - list-item class for the each of the list of the navbar items

- class is preferred than id
    -  For example, if there are two elements with different position then class globe can be used
    - Then, nth-child() combinator can be used to give specific position

- button is an inline element
    - Therefore, button can used instead of placing inside the span tag to get the inline effect
- most used inline tags
```html
<a>
```
```html
<i>
```
```html
<span> 
```
```html
<select>
```
```html
<label>
```
```html
<input>
```   
```html
<button>
```
